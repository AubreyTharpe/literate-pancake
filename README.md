# Literate Pancake

> As developers of software, it is important to remember that we must be more than just proficient with programming languages and development tools; developing elegant software is a matter of craftsmanship. A good understand of data structures and algorithms is an important part of becoming such a craftsman.

## About

I am not a literate pancake.

The purpose of this repo is to refresh my skills in C and to practice test-driven development so that I may become a literate pancake.

I am using two resources on my journey to literate pancakium:

- [Mastering Algorithms with C](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1565924533)
- [Test-Driven Development for Embedded C](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/193435662X)

As a byproduct of me doing this, I'll have documented how to do TDD as well as how these algorithms work. So that for the future anyone that comes across this may follow along to hone their skills or to have a suit of tests to ensure their algorithms function properly.
